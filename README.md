# Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) Prediction

This project applies machine learning techniques to predict Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) using real-world patient data. It is based on medical features such as blood pressure, serum creatinine, hemoglobin, albumin levels, and more. The goal is to assist early diagnosis using automated predictive models.

## 📂 Dataset

- Source: [UCI Machine Learning Repository - CKD Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/chronic_kidney_disease)
- Samples: 400 patients
- Features: 24 (mixed numerical and categorical)
- Target: `classification` (ckd / notckd)

---

## 🔄 Preprocessing Steps

- Handled missing values represented by `'?'`
- Converted data types using `pandas.to_numeric` where necessary
- Imputed:
  - Numerical columns with **median**
  - Categorical columns with **mode**
- Encoded categorical labels (e.g., `ckd` = 1, `notckd` = 0)
- Feature scaling applied for model training

## 🚀 Deployment Ready

You can load the `.sav` model in a Streamlit or Flask app for real-time CKD predictions.

```python
# Save the model as .sav
model_path = "ckd_rf_model.sav"
joblib.dump(model, model_path)

# Save scaler too for deployment use
scaler_path = "ckd_scaler.sav"
joblib.dump(scaler, scaler_path)

## 📝 How to Use

1. **Clone the repository**  
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/yourusername/chronic-kidney-disease-prediction.git
  cd chronic-kidney-disease-prediction
  ```

2. **Install dependencies**  
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

3. **Run the notebook**  
  Open `chronic_kidney_disease_prediction.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code to explore EDA, preprocessing, and model training steps.

4. **Deploy the model**  
  Use the provided `.pkl` or `.sav` files (`random_forest_classification_model.pkl`, `ckd_rf_model.sav`, and `ckd_scaler.sav`) in your preferred deployment framework (e.g., Streamlit or Flask) for real-time predictions.

5. **Sample prediction**  
  See `CKD_Model_Deployment_Deepika.ipynb` for an example of loading the model and making predictions on new data.
