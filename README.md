# Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) Prediction

This project applies machine learning techniques to predict Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) using real-world patient data. It is based on medical features such as blood pressure, serum creatinine, hemoglobin, albumin levels, and more. The goal is to assist early diagnosis using automated predictive models.

## üìÇ Dataset

- Source: [UCI Machine Learning Repository - CKD Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/chronic_kidney_disease)
- Samples: 400 patients
- Features: 24 (mixed numerical and categorical)
- Target: `classification` (ckd / notckd)

---

## üîÑ Preprocessing Steps

- Handled missing values represented by `'?'`
- Converted data types using `pandas.to_numeric` where necessary
- Imputed:
  - Numerical columns with **median**
  - Categorical columns with **mode**
- Encoded categorical labels (e.g., `ckd` = 1, `notckd` = 0)
- Feature scaling applied for model training

## üöÄ Deployment Ready

You can load the `.pkl` model in a Streamlit or Flask app for real-time CKD predictions.

```python
import pickle
with open("random_forest_classification_model.pkl", "rb") as f:
    model = pickle.load(f)
